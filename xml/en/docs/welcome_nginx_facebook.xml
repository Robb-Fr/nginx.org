<initial>Q:</initial>
I am trying to open Facebook, Yahoo!, Google, or some
other well-known web site and instead I am getting a blank web page
with a message referring to nginx: &ldquo;Welcome to nginx!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;404 Not Found / nginx&rdquo;.
</para>

<para>
I suspect something is wrong and there is probably a malicious attempt here
to direct me to a rogue web page (for hacking my computer, phishing etc.).
Why is that and what has nginx to do with my attempts to connect
to Facebook (Yahoo!, Google, etc.) ?

nginx is among the 3 most popular web servers in the world.
It is a free open source server software which is absolutely legitimate and
has nothing to do with any kind of threatening or malicious activity per se.
A web page saying &ldquo;Welcome to nginx!&rdquo; is one of the diagnostics
responses that can be produced by an Internet server running nginx.

<para>
However, you are right in your assumption that something must be wrong
with your computer or browser, or operating system setup when you are
trying to access a well known web site and instead of a familiar page you get
&ldquo;Welcome to nginx!&rdquo;. This should not happen if your computer
is clean and safe.
</para>

<para>
We recommend you to check and verify your entire system setup
(possibly with the help of your ISP or another support personnel),
and it would also be a good idea to install and run an anti-virus software
on your computer. It may happen that some malign entity is trying
to divert the traffic from your computer to a different server and
potentially cause significant harm to you and the other users on
the Internet.
