<b>Q:</b>
I am trying to open Facebook (Yahoo!, Google, etc.) or some
other well known web site and instead I am getting a blank web page
with a message referring to nginx “Welcome to nginx!” or
“404 Not Found / nginx”.
</para>

<para>
I suspect something is wrong and there is probably a malicious attempt here
to direct me to a rogue web page (for hacking my computer, phishing etc.).
Why is that and what nginx has to do with my attempts to connect
to Facebook (Yahoo!, Google, etc.) ?

<b>A:</b>
nginx is among the 3 most popular web servers in the world.
It is a free open source software which is absolutely legitimate and
has nothing to do with any kind of threatening or malicious activity per se.
A web page saying “Welcome to nginx!” is one of the diagnostics responses
that can be produced by a server running nginx.

<para>
However, you are right in your assumption that something must be wrong
with your computer or operating system setup when you are trying to access
a well known web site and instead of a familiar page you get
“Welcome to nginx!”. This should not happen if your computer is clean and safe.
We recommend you to check and verify your operating system setup
(possibly with the help of your ISP or support staff),
but also it would be a good idea to install and run an anti-virus software
on your computer. It may happen that some malign entity is trying
to intercept the traffic from your computer and potentially cause
significant harm to you and the other users on the Internet.
